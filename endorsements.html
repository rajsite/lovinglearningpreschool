<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>The purpose of this letter is to recommend The Loving Learning Preschool, 
run by Reema and Kirit Raj, to any parent who wants their child to attend 
a structured, fun, diverse, preschool. </p>
<p> Our child, Tucker, began attending The Loving Learning Preschool 
when he was just 10 months old. We had recently moved from Dallas 
to Austin and knew no one. I searched for the right child care provider 
for weeks. In Dallas, Tucker thrived in the one-on-one care that he 
received from an in home sitter. Of course we wanted him to be just 
as happy in Austin. We received Reema's name and phone number from 
a community referral site and knew the moment that we heard her voice 
that she would be the perfect person to care for our little boy. We 
liked the fact that she had been a private school teacher for 10 years. 
Additionally, we appreciated the fairness and professionalism with 
which she ran the business. </p>
<p> Tucker is now 5 years old. He has attended The Loving Learning Preschool 
since he was 10 months old. Immediately Reema stopped him from putting 
things in his mouth. He walked at 12 months and was using the word 
"actually" appropriately in a sentence by age 2. Reema was teaching 
him things (like table manners) before I realized that he was able 
to learn them. Soon came Spanish lessons, Spanish songs, and Spanish 
colors thanks to an additional teacher, Ms. Torres. (That brought 
the student/teacher ratio at The Loving Learning Preschool to around 
8 to 3). We were very pleased! </p>
<p>
Additionally, we knew that Tucker was having fun every day.  He literally
jumped out of our arms into Reema's each morning! Now he runs to the
door with hardly a backwards glance towards his parents.
</p>
<p> Next month Tucker will leave The Loving Learning Preschool to begin 
kindergarten at Steiner Ranch Elementary. When we went to register 
it was such a wonderful feeling to know that he had mastered everything 
on the kindergarten checklist. He actually reads at a 2nd grade level 
and can do simple addition and subtraction! </p>
<p> We would be happy to provide any additional information that would 
help prospective parents in deciding whether or not the Loving Learning 
Preschool would be a good fit for their child. I have given Reema 
permission to give out our phone number to prospective parents. </p>
<p>
Best wishes for your child's happy and healthy growth and development!<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Amy &amp; Braden Davis<br />
(Parents of Tucker Davis, Age 5)<br />

<p>Dear Parents and Caregivers,</p>
<p>
My name is Jennifer Moon and my daughter Zoe attended Reema Raj's 
home childcare, "Loving Learning Preschool" for almost four years. 
She started there at 11 months and was in her care until she was 4 and 1/2,
when I began maternity leave for my second child.
</p>
<p>
I have had many occasions to observe her operation, as I frequently 
chatted with her and the children at length when I had the time during 
pick-up or drop-off.
</p>
<p>
Zoe thrived with Reema and Raj and I highly recommend their care. Reema 
engages the children with a variety of activities and responds to their 
individual needs promptly and lovingly. She also frequently attends 
specialized training in early childhood development and is always looking 
for ways to improve her daycare. Almost every week there was a new game, 
educational toy, or activity that she introduced. I appreciated the 
face that she was always firm but gentle in helping children learn acceptable 
behaviors. She was always very consistent with the children and gave 
each individual attention numerous times daily.
</p>
<p>
With my help at home and at Loving Learning Preschool, Zoe learned 
to read very well before she even started Kindergarten. She also learned 
all the concepts, if not more, that she would need to enter Kindergarten, 
including colors, shapes, numbers, writing the alphabet, etc...
</p>
<p>
Reema is also very good about communicating with parents and being responsive 
to their needs and desires for their children. She is flexible in providing 
learning opportunities for various stages of development, both physical 
and educational.
</p>
<p>
Raj is also very caring, gentle, and helpful with the children and is 
often nearby to help Reema guide the children.
</p>
<p>
My only regret is that we have moved and are a little too far away to 
put our second child her care. Again, I highly recommend her home daycare, 
and think you will find it a special place for your child to learn and 
grow.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Jennifer Moon </p>
